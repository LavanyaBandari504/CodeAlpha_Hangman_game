# Hangman Game

## Description
This Hangman game is a simple implementation of the classic word-guessing game. Players try to guess a word by suggesting letters within a certain number of attempts.

## Features
- Randomly selects a word from a predefined list within the script.
- Displays the progress of the word with placeholders for unrevealed letters.
- Allows the player to guess individual letters.
- Tracks the number of attempts remaining.
- Provides feedback on the correctness of guesses.
- Ends the game when the word is guessed correctly or when the player runs out of attempts.
- Displays the correct word if the player loses.

## How to Play
1. Run the game script.
2. You will be prompted to guess a letter.
3. Input a letter and press Enter.
4. If the letter is correct, it will be revealed in the word.
5. If the letter is incorrect, the number of attempts remaining will decrease.
6. Continue guessing letters until you either guess the word correctly or run out of attempts.

## Installation
